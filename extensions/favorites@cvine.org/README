This gnome shell extension for gnome-3.10, 3.12, 3.14, 3.16, 3.18 and
3.20 provides a favorites menu for the gnome panel.  It provides an
alternative to using the shell Overview in order to access the
favorites' dash, and also has a slightly different behavior, namely
that if a particular program is already running, restarting it through
the extension will call up another instance rather than bringing up
the already-running instance.

The panel menu mirrors the Overview dash.  If items are added to or
removed from the dash via the Overview, then they will automatically
be added to or removed from the extension's panel menu.

The extension has selectable preferences, enabling the panel entry to
be represented by text or an icon and its position on the panel to be
chosen.  Preferences can be set from the gnome-shell-extension-prefs
utility (say via gnome-tweak-tool), or by directly accessing GSettings
via, say, dconf-editor (where the settings are at
org->gnome->shell->extensions->favorites).
