2012-12-14 Updated German Translations thanks to Jonatan Zeidler.
           No programmatic changes. Sources same as v12 GS3.4 and v13 GS3.6.
           Uploaded for review.

2013-01-14 Fixed conflicts with some extensions in GS3.6 when screen was locked.
           Fixed inconsistent custom colors in GS3.4 and GS3.6.
           Added pango formating in prefs tool when entering Activities Text,
           ie. <i>Activities</i> displays text in italics.
           Rounded corners are displayed in the color and transparency selected
           for the panel background.  Rounded corners can be hidden.
           The appearance of rounded corners is affected by screen width and
           height ratio, screen resolution, font size and font scaling, screen
           background image and screen background colors and your panel background
           color choice.  The rounded corners with an opaque black panel background
           work well with almost any background image or color.  Other colors and
           levels of transparency for the panel background may or may not work as
           well with your choice of background image or background color.

2013-04-29 Updated for Gnome Shell 3.8.

           Tested on openSuse 12.3, Fedora 19 Alpha and Arch Linux.

           Thanks to Craig Rob, Sven Gjukison and Simon Perry for 
           their valuable testing, patience and comments.  

           Uploaded for review.
  
           The Hot Corner is removed from the Activities Button in Gnome Shell 3.8.
           The functions performed by Hot Corner Sensitivity and Disable Hot Corner
           preferences are changed to continue providing user control of the Hot 
           Corner as described in the following.

           The Hot Corner Sensitivity preference is renamed Hot Corner Threshold.

           The Barrier Pressure System is introduced in Gnome Shell 3.8 to reduce false
           triggers of the Overview and the Message Tray by wayward pointer movements.
           If Extended Barriers are provided by the installed version of the X server
           the Barrier Pressure System is supported.  If supported the Hot Corner 
           Threshold is a pixel value which is used by the Barrier Pressure System to
           calculate the pressure of the pointer pressing against the barrier.  If the
           pressure exceeds the Hot Corner Threshold the Overview is toggled.  With
           Barrier Pressure System support if the Disable Hot Corner preference is ON
           the Hot Corner Threshold is set to a very high value effectively disabling
           the Hot Corner.  The default threshold pressure is 100 pixels.

           If Extended Barriers are not provided the Barrier Pressure System is not 
           functional.  A fallback is implemented in the extension as follows.  The Hot
           Corner Threshold is a value in milliseconds which is used by a timer to delay
           the triggering of the Overview by the Hot Corner.  When the Disable Hot Corner
           preference is ON the Hot Corner is disabled by ignoring Overview toggles
           initiated by the Hot Corner.  The default threshold delay is 250 milliseconds.

2013-05-03 Bug Fix "Remove Activities Button" ON not effective after shell was restarted.

           Changed approach to sync psuedo style of button with hot corner when switching
           to and from Overview to use native shell code instead of extension hack.

2013-05-08 Changed repaint logic to eliminate double paints except when preference settings
           require it.

2013-09-28 Uploaded for review supports GS3.8 and GS3.10

2013-10-12 Created new branch for GS3.8 and GS3.10

2013-11-23 Added logic to handle hot corners on multiple displays. 
           User reported bug hot corner corner was not disabled on 
           secondary display.
 
           Tested on Fedora Beta F20 GS 3.10 with Pressure Barrier, 
           Arch GS 3.10 with Pressure Barrier, openSuse 12.3 GS 3.8 
           without Pressure Barrier.

2014-01-17 Corrected my error that resulted in missing German translations.

2014-04-10 Uploaded new version added 3.12 to metadata.json.

2014-05-02 Added user kubecz3k's suggested feature Window Maximized Effect
           for GS 3.8 and above. kubecz3k saw this effect on a youtube
           video of Elementary Isis: [ http://youtu.be/mzSPGkOyzW8?t=1m30s ].

           For this extension the feature is implemented as follows:

           When a window is maximized on the primary display the panel
           background is affected based on the preference settings.

           1.  No effect on Panel.
           2.  Panel background is set to opaque (transparency removed).
           3.  Panel background is set to opaque and black.

           When the window is unmaximized the panel background returns to the
           original state based on the extension's current preferences.

           Tested on GS 3.8 Fedora 19, GS 3.10 Fedora 20, f20-gnome-3-12 COPR
           and Arch updated today GS 3.12.

2014-10-05 Updated for Gnome Shell 3.14  -  Uploaded for review.

           Changed secondary click response on Activities Text/Icon to execute
           gnome-shell-extension-prefs without the extension as an argument due
           to changes in GS 3.14 to the gnome-shell-extension-prefs tool.  The
           behavior is unchanged for earlier versions.

           Added display of extension version number in prefs widget.
           Added horizontal width request to prefs widget scrolled window.

           Changed readme window displayed by prefs to be modal with a parent.

           from the ego website.  This also fixes a bug of the prefs tool being displayed when
           unlocking the screen.

2015-08-28 Changes to Activities Configurator extension.

           Updated Activities Configurator to hopefully handle Touch Screen.
           I do not have a touch screen device.  Changes were made based on
           current code in panel.js.  

           Added option to hide Application Menu Button Icon. Suggested
           by francoism90.

           Changed layout of extension preferences.  Changed readme.js to
           follow layout change.

           Changed disabled Hot Corner behavior for DND to be the
           same as if Hot Corner is enabled. Dragging an item into
           the Hot Corner will toggle the Overview when the
           Hot Corner is disabled. Suggested by Jehan.

           Fixed bug in Window Maximized Effect which occurred when a
           window was in the maximized state and the extenssion preferences
           were changed from Opaque Background Color to Panel - No Effect.
           Transparency was not being applied after the change.

           Changed Window Maximized Effect to be work with GS 3.17.90 in
           preparation of GS 3.18.

           Cleaned up inconsistent coding style "if(" --> "if ("

2016-01-03 Version 39 passed review GS 3.14 3.16 3.18

2016-02-23 Added configurable shadow box to the panel.
           The panel is a simple rectangle.  The top and sides of
           the panel cannot be shadowed.  Only the bottom is accessible.
           The shadow is effective only in the vertical direction.
           The color, transparency, vertical length, blur radius
           and spread radius can be adjusted with the preferences tool.
           Setting the vertical length to 0 will remove the shadow.
           The panel transparency affects the shadow transparency.
           A high value of panel transparency will cause the shadow
           to be transparent.

           Override Shell Theme Preference

           The following settings interact with User Themes and the Gnome Classic Mode:
           Set Panel Background, Panel Transparency, Panel Shadow Color, Transparency,
           Vertical Length, Blur Radius, Spread Radius and Window Maximized Effect.
           These options are designed to function with the default Gnome Mode and the
           default Shell Theme.  Available User Themes are common and are written
           in ways that do not behave in the same manner as the default Shell Theme.
           The Classic Mode theme is different from the default Shell Theme.  Depending
           on the user's tastes and the theme installed the extension's preferences
           can be used in a useful way.  In some cases some settings are not effective
           or are not useful.  The Override Shell Theme Preference allows the user to
           enable or disable the interactions of the settings that affect the installed
           theme.  The default for the setting is OFF, all listed panel options will
           not interact with an installed User Theme or when in the Gnome Classic Mode.
           The user can set it to ON allowing the listed settings to override or interact
           with the installed theme.  When operating in the default Gnome Mode with the
           default Shell Theme installed the switch is set to OFF and is not sensitive.
           When a theme change occurs from the default Shell Theme to a User Theme or
           the session is in the Gnome Classic Mode the switch is set sensitive in the
           OFF position.  If the user wishes to use any of the listed settings the
           switch can be set to ON.  The option will remain ON until the user sets it
           to OFF or the theme is changed or the mode changes.
